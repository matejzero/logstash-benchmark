logstash-benchmark
==================

I was wondering how logstash performs and how much impact certain plugins, that I intend to use, have on performance.

My test machine was 4x2,5GHz CPU and 8GB RAM.

All tests 3 generator input filters, 3 filter workers and 1 output (graphite and stdout(metrics only).
